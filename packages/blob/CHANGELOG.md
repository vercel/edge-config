# @vercel/blob

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b409aad: We added two new options on `put()`:

  - `addRandomSuffix: boolean`: Allows to disable or enable (default) random
    suffixes added to file paths
  - `cacheControlMaxAge: number`: Allows to configure the browser and edge cache,
    in seconds. Default to one year (browser) and 5 minutes (edge). The edge cache
    is currently always set to a maximum of 5 minutes. But can be lowered to 0

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- e273673: BREAKING CHANGE: Some methods responses and types have been updated following a
  migration Vercel did to make Vercel Blob more robust and closer to the S3 API.

  Namely:

  - the urls generated by Vercel Blob have moved from:
    `public.blob.vercel-storage.com/zyzoioy8txfs14xe/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
    to
    `zyzoioy8txfs14xe.blob.vercel-storage.com/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
    This change has been done transparently: all previous blob urls are
    redirected to the new domain.
  - `.put()` no more sends back size and uploadedAt, use .head() to get this
    information. Refer to the PutBlobResult type.
  - `.list()` no more sends back contentType and contentDisposition on the
    blobs property. Refer to the ListBlobResult type.
  - `.del()` doesn't return any value (void). If the file was here prior to
    a del() call, then it's now deleted.
  - `BlobResult` type has been splitted to `PutBlobResult` for put() and
    `HeadBlobResult` for head(). Use them accordingly.

  We've reworked our README to better surface the browser-upload and
  server-upload methods.
