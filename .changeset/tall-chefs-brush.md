'@vercel/blob': minor

BREAKING CHANGE: Some methods responses and types have been updated following a
migration Vercel did to make Vercel Blob more robust and closer to the S3 API.

Namely:

- the urls generated by Vercel Blob have moved from:
  `public.blob.vercel-storage.com/zyzoioy8txfs14xe/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
  to
  `zyzoioy8txfs14xe.blob.vercel-storage.com/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
  This change has been done transparently: all previous blob urls are
  redirected to the new domain.
- `.put()` no more sends back size and uploadedAt, use .head() to get this
  information. Refer to the PutBlobResult type.
- `.list()` no more sends back contentType and contentDisposition on the
  blobs property. Refer to the ListBlobResult type.
- `.del()` doesn't return any value (void). If the file was here prior to
  a del() call, then it's now deleted.
- `BlobResult` type has been splitted to `PutBlobResult` for put() and
  `HeadBlobResult` for head(). Use them accordingly.

We've reworked our README to better surface the browser-upload and
server-upload methods.
